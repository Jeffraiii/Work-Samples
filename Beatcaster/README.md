# Beatcaster
This folder holds some of the files that I worked on for Beatcaster, an AR rythm game on the Magic Leap. I am still trying to figure out what files I can share, so the ones in this repo are just miscellaneous pieces of the game. However, they do hold some very important gameplay logic and some core systems.
