# OpenGL Projects
There are 3 projects in this folder: height field, roller coaster, and ray tracer.

Height field takes in a greyscale image and converts it to a height field. It renders the geometry in points, wireframe and traingle mode.

Roller coaster deals with the concept of drawing splines, GLSL shaders, and texture mapping. It takes in a spline file and generates a mesh of rail tracks for the roller coaster. It also uses the spline data to simulate camera movement. 

Ray tracer does backwards ray tracing on a specified scene file, and then renders the output. It deal with concepts of intersection detection, shadow rays, ray casting, barycentric coordinates, etc.
