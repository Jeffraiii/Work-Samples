# List of Games
This folder holds some of the games I coded with C++ using SDL2. These games go over some key concepts in video game programming such as: 3D math, update loop, game state, path finding, etc.

Below you'll find a list describing each game:

Lab06: 2D Endless Runner

Lab07: 2D Tower Defense

Lab12: 3D First-Person Parkour
