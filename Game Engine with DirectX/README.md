# Game Engine
This project was made with DirectX over the course of a semester. The engine has the ability to import custom models, animations, and level files in JSON. It has a basic rendering pipeline, a profiling tool, a physics system, and post-processing capabilities. The engine was divided into 11 phases that built on one another, the one in the repo is the final version.
