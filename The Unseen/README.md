# The Unseen
The Unseen is a top-down stealth game that plays with lighting and shaders in Unity. The player has the ability to teleport and switch between "light" and "dark" state to match the environment. The game went through many iterations, and the one in the repo is the final one. I did all of the engineering and most of the art for this project, over the span of one semester.
